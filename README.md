The add({JSON string}) command appends a JSON strings to the archive.txt file, the get() command retrieves the contents in the  archive.txt file and writes them to the temp.txt file, and clear() command clears the ethe archive.txt upon request.

The temp.txt, archive.txt, micrcoservice.py, transfer.py, and add.py files should all be placed into the same directory.
