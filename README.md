# Microservice_CS361

This is a class project for CS361.

This project reads a temp.txt file for received instructions.  It the adds strings to the archive.txt file, retrieves the contents in the 
archive.txt file and writes them to the temp.txt file, and clears the archive.txt upon request.

The temp.txt, archive.txt, and micrcoservice.py file should all be placed into the same directory.
